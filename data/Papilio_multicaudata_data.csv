"Papilio multicaudata","2018-03-19 13:49:00 -0500","I have to say I am very surprised at the numbers of Two-tailed Swallowtails that have been present in central Texas the past year or so! This is typically a more western species and the central Texas area is pretty close to the far eastern extreme of the range of the species. A number of these have been photographed in the Austin/San Antonio area this spring, including one that @ericisley and I photographed east of Austin near the airport a few days ago. I was out in my yard a while ago and in the distance I saw some big swallowtails visiting some of the thistle blooms I let grow up in the yard. I assumed they were Eastern Tigers which is the common big swallowtail here (along with giant swallowtails) but when I got closer I saw that these swallowtails had the two tails of Two-tailed Swallowtail (this one has broken off tails on the right side), as well as the more narrow black ""tiger stripes"" on the FW. Also note on the underside shot of the FW that the yellow marginal band is not broken up into yellow spots as on Eastern Tiger. Amazingly, there were three of these in my yard just now!","Hays County, TX, USA",30.1989179499,-98.1138029695,"","Two-tailed Swallowtail","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/10313034","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/14288672/medium.jpg?1521487614","greglasley",10313034,"Two-tailed Swallowtail","Insecta",68263,"false",5,0,"2018/03/19 1:49 PM CDT","2018-03-19","2018-03-19 18:49:00 UTC","Central Time (US & Canada)",8,"","","false","","",NA,9706,"2018-03-19 19:37:46 UTC","2018-08-12 02:22:49 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

I have a couple of Pride of Barbados (Caesalpinia pulcherrima) plants in my yard. Though not a native plant, they are drought tolerant and do well in the central Texas summer heat and many butterflies love them. This afternoon I saw a large swallowtail working over one of my plants and I was delighted to see that it was a Two-tailed Swallowtail. This species is uncommon in this area (which is on the eastern edge of the species' range) and this was the first for my yard.","Hays County, TX, USA",30.1984099556,-98.1140342655,NA,"Two-tailed Swallowtail","https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7886659","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/10398771/medium.jpg?1505183494","greglasley",7886659,"Two-tailed Swallowtail","Insecta",68263,"false",4,0,"2017/09/11 3:05 PM CDT","2017-09-11","2017-09-11 20:05:00 UTC","Central Time (US & Canada)",8,"","","false",NA,NA,NA,9706,"2017-09-12 02:36:40 UTC","2017-09-12 14:29:21 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,NA,"false"

Species- These butterflies are a part of class Insecta. They go through complete metamorphosis which means their development consists of egg, larva, pupa, and adult. They grow to be about 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 inches in length and they only live for 2 weeks. There diet consists of just drinking nectar from flowers and while doing that the pollen sticks to them so when they go to the next flower they are pollenating that flower. So even though they live such short lives they can do a lot to help the ecosystem.
